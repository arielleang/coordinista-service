## About the service

The Coordinista app generates an outfit methodically by assessing all the `clothing` resources in your service and determining which items coordinate with one another. The Coordinista app coordinates outfits by filtering the properties of each `clothing` resource.

An `outfit` resource includes many `clothing` resources. Each `clothing` resource can belong to many outfits. The `outfit` resource also discerns clothing items based on type, to include only one item type per outfit.
